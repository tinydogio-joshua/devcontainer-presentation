# devcontainer-presentation

> Note: This project is used for giving _devcontainer presentations/demos_. It utilizes Rust and Postgres, but is not meant to show "good" or production ready Rust or Postgres code. Their usage is more to show how a stack can be spun up in isolation from the host machine, while still interacting with each other quickly and reliably in a fully configured dev environment.
